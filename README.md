# ICIP2---Hyperspectral-Image-Denoising-with-log-based-Robust-PCA

All the files are in the folder "ICIP2-Hyperspectral Image Denoising with log-based Robust PCA".

So the project is divided into two parts for two different papers.

  1) Non-Convex RPCA for the paper: Z. Kang, C. Peng and Q. Cheng, "Robust PCA via Nonconvex Rank Approximation", IEEE ICDM 2015, 2015. Available: 10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506050 [Accessed 30 December 2021].
 
  2) Log-based RPCA for the paper: Liu, Y., Zhang, Q., Chen, Y., Cheng, Q. and Peng, C., 2021. Hyperspectral Image Denoising with Log-based Robust PCA. 2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP).

The implementation for each part is present in seperate folders inside the main folder(ICIP2-Hyperspectral Image Denoising with log-based Robust PCA).
