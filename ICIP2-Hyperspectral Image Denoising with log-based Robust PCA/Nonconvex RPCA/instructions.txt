Please load the image matrices ”moon.mat” and “msk.mat” from the “Example Data” folder before running the Jupyter notebook script.

Note: Due to code limitations we cannot use our own images since we have to make tiny changes to code accordingly. So, we recommend using the “moon.mat” file and the “msk.mat” file. Where, moon.mat is the original image of the moon and msk,mat is not noise that we are adding to it.
